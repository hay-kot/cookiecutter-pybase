# CookieCutter - Pybase

This is my personal Python project starter for CLI/Base Applications. Some Features include...

- Project Management with Poetry
- Global settings 'store' with some helpful defaults
- Pydantic Models
- Selectable License
- Colorful logs with coloredlogs 
- Tiny Utility Library
  - File System Utilities for Stats
- [Optional] Basic [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) Structure
- [Optional] [Rich Tracebacks](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/traceback.html)


Other Ideas:
 - Include a UI library with some default Rich utility cards, like file cards
 - Utility function for zipping a directory with progress bar
